# 15. Input Judgment

In this chapter, we will add input bucket to Note.

## Input Buckets

Input buckets are categories of notes which notes can feed judgment distance values into, and at the result screen a probability graph will be shown for each bucket.

While it's not necessary, it is very useful for players to calibrate their input offset and improve on their accuracy.

## Setup Buckets

Our engine only has one type of note, so one bucket will do.

At the result screen each bucket will be represented by a graphic composed of skin sprites, so we should make it as close to the in game visual of the note as possible. Let's also use milliseconds as the unit.

::: Code pathTemplate="{0}src/engine/data/buckets.{2}"

```ts
export const buckets = defineBuckets({
    note: {
        sprites: [
            {
                id: skin.sprites.note.id,
                x: 0,
                y: 0,
                w: 2,
                h: 2,
                rotation: 0,
            },
        ],
        unit: UnitText.Millisecond,
    },
})
```

```js
export const buckets = defineBuckets({
    note: {
        sprites: [
            {
                id: skin.sprites.note.id,
                x: 0,
                y: 0,
                w: 2,
                h: 2,
                rotation: 0,
            },
        ],
        unit: UnitText.Millisecond,
    },
})
```

## Setup Bucket Windows

Next, we need to set the bucket windows.

Intuitively, we would write the code in Note's `preprocess`. However there is an issue: `preprocess` will be called for every note entity, but bucket windows only need to be set once.

We could move our code to Initialization's `preprocess`, but that violates single responsibility principal.

How should we structure this code cleanly?

## Global Preprocess Pattern

For any preprocess code that we only want to run once globally, let's write them in a new `globalPreprocess` class method.

For Note, that would be setting up the bucket windows (remember to convert windows to millisecond):

::: Code pathTemplate="{0}src/engine/data/archetypes/Note.{2}"

```ts
export class Note extends Archetype {
    // ...

    globalPreprocess() {
        const toMs = (window: JudgmentWindow) => ({
            min: window.min * 1000,
            max: window.max * 1000,
        })

        buckets.note.set({
            perfect: toMs(windows.perfect),
            great: toMs(windows.great),
            good: toMs(windows.good),
        })
    }

    // ...
}
```

```js
export class Note extends Archetype {
    // ...

    globalPreprocess() {
        const toMs = (window: JudgmentWindow) => ({
            min: window.min * 1000,
            max: window.max * 1000,
        })

        buckets.note.set({
            perfect: toMs(windows.perfect),
            great: toMs(windows.great),
            good: toMs(windows.good),
        })
    }

    // ...
}
```

:::

Currently, `globalPreprocess` isn't called anywhere. Let's make Initialization call it:

::: Code pathTemplate="{0}src/engine/data/archetypes/Initialization.{2}"

```ts
export class Initialization extends Archetype {
    preprocess() {
        // ...

        archetypes.Note.globalPreprocess()
    }

    // ...
}
```

```js
export class Initialization extends Archetype {
    preprocess() {
        // ...

        archetypes.Note.globalPreprocess()
    }

    // ...
}
```

:::

Now Note's `globalPreprocess` will be called once globally, because there is only one Initialization.

However, for every new archetype that needs `globalPreprocess`, we will have to remember to add to Initialization. Instead, let's iterate over archetypes and call every one that has a `globalPreprocess` method:

::: Code pathTemplate="{0}src/engine/data/archetypes/Initialization.{2}"

```ts
export class Initialization extends Archetype {
    preprocess() {
        // ...

        for (const archetype of Object.values(archetypes)) {
            if (!('globalPreprocess' in archetype)) continue

            archetype.globalPreprocess()
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

```js
export class Initialization extends Archetype {
    preprocess() {
        // ...

        for (const archetype of Object.values(archetypes)) {
            if (!('globalPreprocess' in archetype)) continue

            archetype.globalPreprocess()
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

:::

That's the global preprocess pattern implemented.

## Input Result

Lastly, let's set input result's bucket index and value:

::: Code pathTemplate="{0}src/engine/data/archetypes/Note.{2}"

```ts
export class Note extends Archetype {
    // ...
    touch() {
        // ...

        for (const touch of touches) {
            // ...

            this.result.bucket.index = buckets.note.index
            this.result.bucket.value = this.result.accuracy * 1000

            // ...
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

```js
export class Note extends Archetype {
    // ...
    touch() {
        // ...

        for (const touch of touches) {
            // ...

            this.result.bucket.index = buckets.note.index
            this.result.bucket.value = this.result.accuracy * 1000

            // ...
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```
