# 23. Particle Effect

In this chapter, we will add particle effects to notes.

## Particle Effect

Particle effect gives player a powerful visual feedback especially in response to player actions, which improves gameplay enjoyment drastically.

We are going to add a particle effect when a note is tapped, centered at the judgment point, with radius `0.4`, lasts `0.3` seconds, and no loop, by calling `SpawnParticleEffect`:

```ts
const touch = And(
    // ...
    [
        // ...
        SpawnParticleEffect(
            ParticleEffect.NoteCircularTapCyan,
            -0.4,
            -1,
            -0.4,
            -0.2,
            0.4,
            -0.2,
            0.4,
            -1,
            0.3,
            false
        ),
    ]
)
```

```js
const touch = And(
    // ...
    [
        // ...
        SpawnParticleEffect(
            ParticleEffect.NoteCircularTapCyan,
            -0.4,
            -1,
            -0.4,
            -0.2,
            0.4,
            -0.2,
            0.4,
            -1,
            0.3,
            false
        ),
    ]
)
```
